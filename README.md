# Constructor-Word-Guess

**Before use, install packages *npm install***

This project was to create an app that can be brought up on the terminal in order to play a word guess game.

1. Enter a letter to make a guess.
    * If the guess was correct, you would have the same number of guesses and the letter will appear.
    * If the guess was incorrect, you lose a guess.
    * Spaces count as a letter.
    
2. If you run out of guesses, the game is over.

3. If you guess the country correctly, the game is also over.

4. You can choose to play again afterwards.
